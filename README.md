# Coursera-Meta-Front-End-Developer-Professional-Certificate
A place for me to store solutions from the courses in the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate on Coursera.

I will only upload instructions and solutions to the mandatory excercise labs, I'm skipping other assignments, practice assignments and quizzes.  

Each course is in a seperate folder and each week of the course has a seperate subfolder.
